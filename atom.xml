        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the addition of end-to-end job streaming capabilities in Zeebe, we wanted to measure the improvements in job activation latency:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much is a single job activation latency reduced?</li>
<li>How much is the activation latency reduced between each task of the same process instance?</li>
<li>How much is the activation latency reduced on large clusters with a high broker and partition count?</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we wanted to guarantee that every component involved in streaming, including clients, would remain resilient in the face of load surges.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Job activation latency is greatly reduced, with task based workloads seeing up to 50% reduced overall execution latency. Completing a task now immediately triggers pushing out the next one, meaning the latency to activate the next task in a sequence is bounded by how much time it takes to process its completion in Zeebe. Activation latency is unaffected by how many partitions or brokers there in a cluster, as opposed to job polling, thus ensuring scalability of the system. Finally, reuse of gRPC's flow control mechanism ensure clients cannot be overloaded even in the face of load surges, without impacting other workloads in the cluster.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-job-activation-latency-matters">Why job activation latency matters<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#why-job-activation-latency-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why job activation latency matters" title="Direct link to Why job activation latency matters">​</a></h2>
<p>Jobs are one of the fundamental building blocks of Zeebe, representing primarily all tasks (e.g. service, send, user), as well as some less obvious symbols (e.g. intermediate message throw event). In essence, they represent the actual unit of work in a process, the part users will implement, i.e. the actual application code. To reduce the likelihood of a job being worked on by multiple clients at the same time, it first goes through an activation process, where it is soft-locked for a specific amount of time. Soft-locked here means anyone can still interact with it - they can complete the job, fail it, etc. Only the activation is locked out, meaning no one else can activate the job until it's timed out.</p>
<p>This means that most workloads will consist mostly of job interactions: creation, activation, completion, etc. As such, it's critical to ensure clients receive jobs as fast as possible in order to make progress.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="polling-a-first-implementation">Polling: a first implementation<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#polling-a-first-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Polling: a first implementation" title="Direct link to Polling: a first implementation">​</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, Zeebe introduced the <code>ActivateJobs</code> RPC for its gRPC clients, analogous to fetching and locking <a href="https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.20/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external tasks in Camunda 7.x</a>. This endpoint allowed clients to activate fetch and activate a specific number of available jobs. In other words, it allowed them to <em>poll</em> for jobs.</p>
<p>This was the first implementation to activate and work on jobs in Zeebe for multiple reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>It follows a simple request/response pattern</li>
<li>Flow control is delegated to the client/user</li>
<li>Most other approaches will build onto the building blocks used by polling</li>
<li>You will likely implement polling anyway as a fallback for other approaches (e.g. pushing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grossly simplified, the implementation worked like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Job polling" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/job-poll-fbf0a5b11cac5467c5daba1424bc9230.png" width="784" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>A client initiates an <code>ActivateJobs</code> call by sending an initial request</li>
<li>The gateway receives the request and validates it</li>
<li>The gateway starts polling each partition synchronously one by one</li>
<li>Whenever jobs are received from a partition, it forwards them to the client</li>
<li>When all partitions are exhausted, or the maximum number of jobs have been activated, the request is closed</li>
</ul>
<p>Already we can infer certain performance bottle necks based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every request - whether client to gateway, or gateway to broker - adds delay to the activation latency</li>
<li>In the worst case scenario, we have to poll <em>every</em> partition.</li>
<li>The gateway does not know in advance which partitions have jobs available.</li>
<li>Scaling out your clients may have adverse effects by sending out too many requests which all have to be processed independently</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/11813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you have a lot of jobs, you can run into major performance issues when accessing the set of available jobs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So if we have, say, 30 partitions, and each gateway-to-broker request takes 100ms, fetching the jobs on the last partition will take up to 3 seconds, even though the actual activation time on that partition was only 100ms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we have a sequence of tasks, fetching the next task in the sequence requires, in the worst case scenario, another complete round of polling through all the partitions, even though the task may already be available.</p>
<p>One would think a workaround to this issue would simply be to poll more often, but this can have an adverse impact: each polling request has to be processed by the brokers, and sending too many will simply flood your brokers and slow down all processing, further compounding the problem.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="long-polling-a-second-implementation">Long polling: a second implementation<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#long-polling-a-second-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Long polling: a second implementation" title="Direct link to Long polling: a second implementation">​</a></h3>
<p>To simplify things, the Zeebe team introduced <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/2825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long polling in 2019</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long polling</a> is a fairly common technique to emulate a push or streaming approach while maintaing the request-response pattern of polling. Essentially, if the server has nothing to send to the client, instead of completing the request it will hold it until content is available, or a timeout is reached.</p>
<p>In Zeebe, this means that if we did not reach the maximum number of jobs to activate after polling all partitions, the request is parked but not closed. Eventually when jobs are available, the brokers will make this information known to the gateways, who will then unpark the oldest request and start a new polling round.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Job polling" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/job-long-poll-87a951a59369f8452d9a3e2f36421d8e.png" width="784" height="835" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This solved certain problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>We reduced the amount of requests sent by clients, thus reducing load on the cluster.</li>
<li>In some cases, we reduced the latency when activating the next task in sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are still some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>When receiving the notification we <em>still</em> have to poll all partitions.</li>
<li>If you have multiple gateways, all gateways will start polling if they have parked requests. Some of them may not get any jobs, but they will still have sent requests to brokers which still all have to be processed.</li>
<li>In high load cases, you still need another client request/poll cycle to fetch the next task in a sequence.</li>
<li>Scaling out your clients still add more load on the system, even if the poll less often</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="job-push-third-times-the-charm">Job push: third time's the charm<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#job-push-third-times-the-charm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job push: third time's the charm" title="Direct link to Job push: third time's the charm">​</a></h2>
<p>In order to solve these issues, the team decided to implement <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/11231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a push-based approach to job activation</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, we added a new <code>StreamActivatedJobs</code> RPC to our gRPC protocol, a so-called <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#server-streaming-rpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">server streaming RPC</a>. In our case, this is meant to be a long-lived stream, such that the call is completed only if the client terminates it, or if the server is shutting down.</p>
<p>The stream itself has the following lifecycle:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Job push" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/job-push-a314bcca5464ddee542b00633cc58d1b.png" width="784" height="612" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>The client initiates the stream by sending a job activation request much like with the <code>ActivateJobs</code> RPC.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Since the stream is meant to be long lived, however, there is no upper bound on the number of jobs to activate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The gateway registers the new stream with all brokers in the cluster<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note that there is no direct connection between brokers and client; the gateway acts as a proxy for the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When jobs are available for activation (e.g. on creation, on timeout, on backoff, etc.), the broker activates the job and pushes it to the gateway.</li>
<li>The gateway forwards the job to the client.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/job-workers/#how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read more about the implementation as part of our docs.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experienced readers will immediately spot that push-based approaches run the risk of overloading the client. Thanks to the built-in flow control facilities of gRPC, we can still ensure clients are resilient in the face of load surges. See <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/job-workers/#backpressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here for an explanation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This solved most, if not all, of the problems listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brokers push jobs out immediately as they become available, removing the need for a gateway-to-broker request.</li>
<li>Since the stream is long lived, there are almost no client requests required after the initial one.</li>
<li>No need to poll every partition anymore.</li>
<li>No thundering herd issues if you have many gateways all polling at the same time due to a notification.</li>
<li>Scaling out your clients adds little to no load to the system, as idle clients simply do nothing.</li>
<li>Even if you have a lot of jobs, in the average case, you never have to iterate over them and instead the broker pushes the job out on creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>As our baseline test, we ran a constant throughput of 150 PI/s of a single task process workload:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A single task BPMN process: start -&amp;gt; task -&amp;gt; end" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/single-task-bpmn-99ed3a15761cf3fbe8bfdc20807d4c7e.png" width="999" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Since each job takes at least 50ms of work, the lower bound execution latency for this process is 50ms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Results of 150 PI/s single task process" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/single-task-benchmark-4ef8a419140fd42094f359a54a74000b.png" width="1907" height="867" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The results show a sharp decrease in both the p50 and p99 of the job lifetime (i.e. the time between creation and completion). Since this workload only consists of a single task, this is mirrored in the overall process execution latency. Overall, we see that switching to a push approach yields a p50 latency improvement of 50%, and a p99 improvement of 75%!</p>
<p>Additionally, we can see with job push that the Zeebe the p50 processing overhead is ~14ms, and the p99 ~390ms. For job polling, the p50 overhead is ~70ms, and the p99 overhead is ~1.7s.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ten-tasks">Ten tasks<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#ten-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ten tasks" title="Direct link to Ten tasks">​</a></h4>
<p>For our next test, we ran a constant throughput of 150 PI/s of a ten tasks sequence process:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A ten tasks sequence BPMN process: start -&amp;gt; task_1 -&amp;gt; task_2 -&amp;gt; ... -&amp;gt; task_10 -&amp;gt; end" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/ten-tasks-bpmn-2617d2c0ddb0a87947bd2019efb66e74.png" width="2247" height="1137" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Since each job takes at least 50ms of work, the lower bound execution latency for this process is 500ms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Results of 150 PI/s single task process" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/ten-tasks-benchmark-bdae0ac5942ee080b193dbe7294ced1f.png" width="1901" height="864" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The results show a sharp decrease in both the p50 and p99 of the job lifetime (i.e. the time between creation and completion). In this case, the process consists of several tasks, so the process execution latency is noticeably higher. But we can see that the p50 latency for job push is ~640ms. Overall, we see that switching to a push approach yields a p50 latency improvement of 30%, and a p99 improvement of 50%!</p>
<p>Additionally, we can see with job push that the Zeebe the p50 processing overhead is ~140ms, and the p99 ~1.8s. For job polling, the p50 overhead is ~1.4s, and the p99 overhead is ~4.3s.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="large-cluster">Large cluster<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#large-cluster" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Large cluster" title="Direct link to Large cluster">​</a></h4>
<p>In order to verify that the approach will scale along with the cluster size, we next compared polling and pushing with a cluster of 30 brokers and 30 partitions. Again, we tested with the single task process as above, and a constant throughput of 150 PI/s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Results of 150 PI/s against a large cluster" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/thirty-partitions-benchmark-63cde3904d51c5b209efc0a1e9aad02e.png" width="1905" height="859" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>For job push, we see a greatly improved p99 - since each partition is doing less work than before with 3 partitions, we can achieve much more stable performance, with the p99 being quite close to the p50.</p>
<p>For job poll however, we see the downside of having to poll each partition in turn: the p50 is worse than before, and even though the p99 is greatly improved, we can see a wave pattern where it will spike up to 3s, so a decrease compared to the smaller cluster.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="client-backpressure--load-surges">Client backpressure &amp; load surges<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2024/01/19/Job-Activation-Latency#client-backpressure--load-surges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Client backpressure &amp; load surges" title="Direct link to Client backpressure &amp; load surges">​</a></h4>
<p>One of the downsides of switching to a push approach, unfortunately, is that the client is now at risk of receiving more work than it can safely handle.</p>
<p>Thankfully, HTTP/2 and gRPC both have mechanisms to ensure flow control for server streaming RPCs.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Zeebe now supporting the addition and removal of brokers to a running cluster, we wanted to test three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there an impact on processing performance while scaling?</li>
<li>Is scaling resilient to high processing load?</li>
<li>Can scaling up improve processing performance?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Scaling up works even under high load and has low impact on processing performance. After scaling is complete, processing performance improves in both throughput and latency.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="impact-of-scaling-on-processing-performance">Impact of scaling on processing performance<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/20/Broker-scaling-performance#impact-of-scaling-on-processing-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact of scaling on processing performance" title="Direct link to Impact of scaling on processing performance">​</a></h2>
<p>Scaling up and down is an expensive operation where partition data is transferred between brokers, and leadership for partitions changes.
We wanted to test how much impact this has on regular processing performance.</p>
<p>To do this, we ran a benchmark with 3 brokers, 6 partitions and replication factor 3.</p>
<p>The brokers are limited to 1.35 CPUs and 4GiB RAM each.
They run with additional safety checks that are usually disabled in production and that slightly decrease the baseline processing performance.
Each broker uses a small 32GiB SSD for storage, limiting them to a few thousand IOPS.</p>
<p>The processing load was 150 processes per second, with a large payload of 32KiB each.
Each process instance has a single service task:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/one_task-f083f237e568d87cc17eef056cb45d73.png" width="999" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The processing load is generated by our own <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/9e723b21b0e408fc2b97fd7d3f6b092af8e62dbe/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benchmarking application</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/20/Broker-scaling-performance#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>When we scale up from 3 to 6 brokers, we expect a small impact on processing performance.
Request latency may increase slightly, some requests may time out and some will be rejected due to backpressure.
The overall throughput in terms of created and completed process instances as well as jobs may similarly decrease slightly.</p>

<p>We see a short increase in process instance duration, meaning that some process instances were finished slightly slower than before.</p>

<p>The throughput in terms of created and completed process instances and jobs remained very stable.</p>

<p>We see a small increase in requests timing out or getting rejected by backpressure.</p>

<p>Overall, this matches our expectation and shows that scaling up has a small impact on processing performance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scaling-under-load">Scaling under load<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/20/Broker-scaling-performance#scaling-under-load" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaling under load" title="Direct link to Scaling under load">​</a></h2>
<p>Since scaling up is supposed to alleviate high processing load for brokers, it's important that it works even under high load.
For this test, we increased the load on the same cluster setup as before to 210 instead of 150 process instances per second.
This is roughly the maximum throughput that the 3 brokers with 6 partitions and replication factor 3 can handle.
We can see this from the relatively high backpressure, as well as high process instance duration.</p>

<p>We expect that scaling up to 6 brokers will still complete successfully, even under high load.
The time it takes until scaling is complete might be slightly higher.
The impact on processing performance, both in terms of throughput and latency, may be slightly larger than in the previous experiment.</p>

<p>The process instance duration did not increase, and even decreased slightly.

<p>Similarly, the throughput in terms of created and completed process instances and jobs remained relatively stable.

<p>The number of failed requests increased slightly, but still well within an acceptable range.

<p>The scaling operation took 5 minutes, a good portion of which is waiting for the new brokers to get scheduled and start up.</p>
<p>Overall, this matches our expectation and shows that scaling can complete fast and with low impact on processing performance, even under high load.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scaling-up-to-improve-performance">Scaling up to improve performance<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/20/Broker-scaling-performance#scaling-up-to-improve-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaling up to improve performance" title="Direct link to Scaling up to improve performance">​</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious goal of scaling brokers is to unlock additional processing performance.
While vertical scaling is also a great option, this can hit limits imposed by your infrastructure provider.
For example, some machine types may offer great CPU performance but are severely limited in IOPS.
Additionally, vertical scaling is often more expensive than horizontal scaling.
It also comes with increased risk when a single machine fails because the remaining machines may already run at their limits and will then struggle to handle the additional load during failover.</p>
<p>To show how broker scaling can improve processing performance, we reused the same cluster setup as before.
We have 3 brokers, 6 partitions and replication factor 3.</p>
<p>The brokers are limited to 1.35 CPUs and 4GiB RAM each.
They run with additional safety checks that are usually disabled in production and that slightly decrease the baseline processing performance.
Each broker uses a small 32GiB SSD for storage, limiting them to a few thousand IOPS.</p>
<p>We changed the processing load slightly to simulate a more realistic scenario.
The new process model consists of 10 tasks with two timers in-between, each delaying the process instance by 1 minute.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/ten_tasks-97eff1de6db0dbb79ae9681cedd14a93.png" width="5823" height="576" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The processing load is generated by our own <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/9e723b21b0e408fc2b97fd7d3f6b092af8e62dbe/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benchmarking application</a>, initially starting 40 process instances per second.</p>
<p>This results in 400 jobs created and completed per second.</p>
<p>This stresses the 3 brokers and we see backpressure on all partitions.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_initial_backpressure-ff99c218bd0d2169e80612db06918bee.png" width="628" height="220" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We also see a few jobs timing out, indicating that the cluster is unable to handle this load consistency:
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_initial_timeouts-184ec92cae00e964d1cb981d81c9094c.png" width="840" height="220" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We also see that many jobs are active for much longer than 1 second, even though the workers only delay completion by 50ms.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_initial_job_lifetime-aa635408ad750e58f3c4d5aba42cfb71.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As hinted at before, much of this performance limit can be attributed to the limited IOPS of the small SSDs.
We see this in a very high commit and write latency, while the IOPS remain stable, right at the limit of what the SSDs can handle.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_initial_iops-ef1bfdab00c42f7e496bb8361b82837f.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q">

<p>When we scale up to 6 brokers, and thus distribute the partitions such that each broker is only leader for 1 instead of 2 partitions, we expect that processing performance improves.</p>
<p>As these things usually go, we don't expect a doubling in performance but aiming for a 1.5x improvement seems reasonable.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual-2">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/20/Broker-scaling-performance#actual-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>Shortly after scaling up and after partition leadership has balanced, we see a significant improvement in backpressure.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_backpressure-8ea0858dc7e2dbd99c1d9072ad4e9d9e.png" width="628" height="220" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The job lifetime decreases dramatically, with most jobs now taking &lt; 50ms from creation until completion.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_job_lifetime-1484937ab54af54c7c9c62e4d3f40bed.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Overall processing latency improves similarly.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_processing_latency-0dc8cc62dc0d3416af386c2f7f3b8a7a.png" width="1688" height="258" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Much of this improvement can be attributed to the reduced IOPS.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_iops-9d4cfe0e830dc5b2172dba4cf77c772b.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Commit and write latency improves accordingly.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_commit_latency-3038b133286dfe6303ae585152b74ddf.png" width="840" height="258" class="img_ev3q">

<p>Another source for improved performance is reduced CPU load.
With 3 brokers being leader for 2 partitions each, they were hitting their CPU limits and got throttled by the underlying infrastructure.
With 6 brokers, each only being leader for 1 partition, the CPU load is reduced and brokers are no longer throttled.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_after_cpu-27360ba363b21f8be99ae11009830041.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While this is already a success, we can push things further now.
We are able to increase the load from 40 to 65 process instances per second, resulting in 650 jobs created and completed per second.
This is a 1.6x improvement over the initial load while achieving similar backpressure.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_increased_load_backpressure-50539a70042461e4c0f57395ab9a2981.png" width="628" height="220" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Job lifetime and overall processing latency is still better than before scaling up, even though load increased by 1.6x
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/perf_increased_load_job_lifetime-357a5db1cfce78fb1788dc3bd8dd83c5.png" width="840" height="296" class="img_ev3q">

<p>Overall, this shows that scaling up can improve processing performance significantly, especially when the initial cluster setup is resource limited and vertical scaling is not possible.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We continue our <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/18/Dynamically-scaling-brokers">previous experiments</a> with dynamically scaling by now also testing whether
the cluster survives dataloss during the process.</p>
<p>One goal is to verify that we haven't accidentally introduced a single point of failure in the cluster.
Another is to ensure that data loss does not corrupt the cluster topology.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong>
Even with dataloss, the scaling completes successfully and with the expected results.
We found that during scaling, a single broker of the previous cluster configuration can become a single point of failure by preventing a partition from electing a leader.
This is not exactly a bug, but something that we want to improve.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dataloss-on-the-coordinator">Dataloss on the Coordinator<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/19/Dynamic-Scaling-with-Dataloss#dataloss-on-the-coordinator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dataloss on the Coordinator" title="Direct link to Dataloss on the Coordinator">​</a></h2>
<p>Zeebe uses Broker 0 as the coordinator for changes to the cluster topology.
While changes can only be initiated by the coordinator, losing the coordinator and it's data should not prevent the scaling operation from completing.
When the coordinator restarts without any data, it should be able to recover the cluster topology as well as the partition data from the remaining brokers.</p>
<p>To test this, we use the <code>zbchaos dataloss delete</code> and <code>zeebe dataloss recover</code> commands.
After deleting, the broker will not restart directly, instead waiting for the <code>zbchaos dataloss recover</code> command to be executed.
The <code>zbchaos dataloss recover</code> command only unblocks the broker and allows it to start, it does not restore any data and we rely on normal replication for that.</p>
<p>Shortly after triggering a scale up with <code>zbchaos cluster scale --brokers 6</code>, we trigger dataloss on the coordinator with <code>zbchaos broker dataloss delete --nodeId 0</code>.
After observing the system for a while, we then restore the coordinator with <code>zbchaos dataloss recover --nodeId 0</code>.</p>

<p>The scaling operation eventually completes with the expected result of 6 brokers and 6 partitions, evenly distributed.
The coordinator recovers after dataloss and eventually receives the cluster topology from the remaining brokers.
The scaling operation should make progress while the coordinator is down.</p>

<p>The coordinator is a member of partition 5 but there are two remaining members of partition 5 that should allow broker 5 to join.

<p>Overall, we achieve our goal that the scaling operation eventually completes with the expected result.
The coordinator recovers after dataloss and eventually receives the cluster topology from the remaining brokers.</p>
<p>However, it was unexpected that the scaling did not make progress while the coordinator was down.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="single-point-of-failure-during-scaling">Single point of failure during scaling<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/19/Dynamic-Scaling-with-Dataloss#single-point-of-failure-during-scaling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Single point of failure during scaling" title="Direct link to Single point of failure during scaling">​</a></h2>
<p>The issue that scaling did not make progress while the coordinator was reproducible.
Eventually, we diagnosed it as the following edge case:</p>
<p>When scaling up and and adding a new member to the replication group of a partition, the raft partition goes through joint consensus.
The details of this process are described in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raft paper</a>, but here is a very short summary:
Joint consensus is similar to a 2-phase commit, where the leader of the partition first introduces a new <em>joint consensus</em> configuration that requires quorum from both the old and new set of members.
After committing the joint consensus configuration, the leader leaves joint consensus by "forgetting" the old member set and only using the new member set.
Only after this second configuration is committed, joining of the new member is complete.</p>
<p>In our example, the new set of members has size 4, one of which is the coordinator and one is the newly joining member.
With 4 members, the quorum is 3, meaning that the partition can only elect a leader and process if at least 3 members are available.
In our experiment, we made the coordinator unavailable, so we were already down to 3 members.
Additionally, the newly joining member did not start yet because it was waiting for a successful join response from the leader.
The newly joining member never received such a response because the joint-consensus phase was not completed.
This resulted in only 2 out of 4 members being available, which is not enough to elect a leader.</p>
<p>We want to improve this behavior in the future but likely can't prevent it completely.
That means that there is an increased risk of unavailable partitions during scaling.
However, this only occurs if another broker becomes unavailable with an unfortunate timing and resolves itself automatically once the broker is available again.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We experimented with the first version of <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/cluster-scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic scaling in Zeebe</a>, adding or removing brokers for a running cluster.</p>
<p>Scaling up and down is a high-level operation that consists of many steps that need to be carried co-operatively by all brokers in the cluster.
For example, adding new brokers first adds them to the replication group of the assigned partitions and then removes some of the older brokers from the replication group.
Additionally, <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/priority-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">priorities</a> need to be reconfigured to ensure that the cluster approaches balanced leadership eventually.</p>
<p>This orchestration over multiple steps ensures that all partitions are replicated by at least as many brokers as configured with the <code>replicationFactor</code>.
As always, when it comes to orchestrating distributed systems, there are many edge cases and failure modes to consider.</p>
<p>The goal of this experiment was to verify that the operation is resilient to broker restarts.
We can accept that operations take longer than usual to complete, but we need to make sure that the operation eventually succeeds with the expected cluster topology as result.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Both scaling up and down is resilient to broker restarts, with the only effect that the operation takes longer than usual to complete.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scaling-up-should-be-resilient-to-broker-restarts">Scaling up should be resilient to broker restarts<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/18/Dynamically-scaling-brokers#scaling-up-should-be-resilient-to-broker-restarts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaling up should be resilient to broker restarts" title="Direct link to Scaling up should be resilient to broker restarts">​</a></h2>
<p>We start with a cluster of 3 brokers, 6 partitions and replication factor 3.
If leadership is balanced, each broker should be leader for 2 partitions and follower for 4 partitions.
Using more partitions than brokers allows us to scale up to more brokers, distributing the partitions such that each broker has less work to do.</p>
<p>For this experiment, we introduce chaos by letting a random broker restart every 30 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/18/Dynamically-scaling-brokers#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>Even when brokers are restarting, the scale operation should eventually succeed.
The expected cluster topology after scaling up is 6 brokers, 6 partitions and replication factor 3, leading to 3 partitions for each broker instead of 6.</p>

<p>The current cluster topology queried with <code>zbchaos cluster status</code> shows 6 partitions with 3 replicas each, evenly distributed across the 3 brokers.</p>

<p>Exactly like scaling up, scaling down is also a high-level operation that consists of many steps that need to be carried out by all brokers in the cluster.
Before a broker can leave, another broker first needs to join the replication group to ensure that we maintain a replication factor of 3 at all times.</p>

<p>Even when brokers are restarting, the scale operation should eventually succeed with the expected cluster topology as result.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today's chaos day we experimented with job push resiliency.</p>
<p>The following experiments we have done today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Job streams should be resilient to gateway restarts/crash</li>
<li>Job streams should be resilient to leadership changes/leader restarts</li>
<li>Job streams should be resilient to cluster restarts</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> All experiments succeeded and showcased the resiliency even on component restarts. <!-- -->🚀</p>
<p>To reduce the blast radius and to better verify that everything works as expected we use a trimmed version of our benchmark setup. This means three brokers, one partition, replication factor three, and one gateway. No starter deployed. We deployed one worker with a very high polling interval, to make sure that we rely on streaming.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gateway-restarts">Gateway restarts<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/12/06/Job-Push-resiliency#gateway-restarts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Gateway restarts" title="Direct link to Gateway restarts">​</a></h2>
<p>In our first experiment, we wanted to verify that: Job streaming should be resilient to gateway restarts/crashes.</p>
<p>The experiment will look like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify steady state:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Cluster is healthy</li>
<li>When creating an instance, and start streaming we can retrieve and complete the corresponding job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chaos injection:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Restarting the gateway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verify steady state:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Cluster is healthy</li>
<li>When creating an instance, and start streaming we can retrieve and complete the corresponding job</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect that even after a gateway restart we can retrieve a job (the stream should be recreated) and complete our new instance.</p>

<p>We deployed the worker (with a replica of one), and configured it with a high polling interval <code>-Dapp.worker.pollingDelay=24h</code>.</p>
<p>To run any instances we need to deploy once the benchmark process model</p>

<p>The experiment succeeded. We were able to verify the steady state after the chaos injection. Furthermore, we observe in the metrics as well that the jobs have been pushed after the gateway restart. <!-- -->✅</p>

<p>We were able to verify that a leader restart doesn't cause issues and job push can handle such events.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/job-push-leader-restart-6e33baa1365cba88fc41cc9bbe92442b.png" width="926" height="866" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see that the leader was changed, and also switched back shortly after.

<p>This is caused by our leader-balancing cron job.

<p>This also means we had two leader changes, and the push was even pushed by the restarted node.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today's chaos day we (Nicolas and I) want to verify how job push behaves and in general, the Zeebe system when we have slow workers.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Right now it seems that even if we have a slow worker it doesn't impact the general system, and only affects the corresponding process instance, not other instances. We found no unexpected issues, everything performed pretty well.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>Firstly we want to verify that job push will not overload a worker or gateway when workers are slow.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>We expect that if the workers are slowing down, the load is distributed to other workers (if available), and it is expected that the general performance (of the affected process instance) should be slowed down. We wouldn't expect any restarts/failures on the gateway or workers.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>We deployed a normal benchmark, with <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/benchmarks/setup/default/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default configurations</a>.</p>
<p>We slowed the workers down, in the sense that we changed <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/benchmark-helm/blob/main/charts/zeebe-benchmark/templates/worker.yaml#L30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the completionDelay to 1250 ms</a></p>

<p>The throughput is lower than normal, as expected.</p>
<p>We see no significant increase in memory usage on the gateway, nor any outages because of this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp1-gw-memory-220a9ab49a649d351bb58040bde2c4a0.png" width="628" height="307" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We see that a high amount of job pushes fail (due to capacity constraints now in the workers).
!Jobs are yielded back to the engine.</p>

<p>So far so good, first experiment worked as expected <!-- -->✅</p>

<p>The normal scenario when something is slow is for a user to scale up. This is what we did in the next experiment, we scaled the workers to 10 replicas (from 3), to verify how the system behaves in this case.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind when the completion delay is 1250ms, we <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/7002d53a079c06ab3a94f5485f022681a41dc9ed/benchmarks/project/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/Worker.java#L113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiply the activation timeout by 6 in our workers</a>. This means completionDelay: 1250 -&gt; job timeout 7.5s</p>

<p>We expect that we can reach a higher throughput.</p>

<p>Scaling the workers to 10:</p>

<p>We can see that after scaling we can complete more jobs.</p>
<p>The gateway memory seems to be not really affected.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-gw-mem-1c710a1cc021fd9a369efee7871a6eef.png" width="633" height="307" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In the job push metrics we see less job push failures.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-job-push-56d12fe3469c8287fdc4b6fca3d7175f.png" width="1247" height="638" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When we check the written records we can see a decrease in yield, but an increase in timeouts. The reason is that we have to try several workers before giving it back.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-records-37ead57c1e5b9bf03bb812ee7d58abf0.png" width="1254" height="342" class="img_ev3q">

<p>Experiment two worked as expected. <!-- -->✅</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="third-chaos-experiment">Third Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#third-chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Third Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Third Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>In a real-world scenario, it will not happen if you have a slow dependency, for which for example a worker waits that you can scale and this will solve your problems. Likely you will get even slower because more pressure is put on the dependency. To mimic this scenario we experimented with increasing the completion time again. A completion delay set to 2500ms, means a job timeout of 15s.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected-2">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#expected-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>We expect after slowing down all workers again, that our throughput goes down again, but we should see no general error. Potentially a slight memory increase because of buffering of jobs.</p>
<p>This also means more yields and fewer timeouts.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual-2">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#actual-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>As expected again we see a drop in throughput, but it is still a bit higher than at the first experiment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp3-general-88403398292f5c5cdbac3a1b9b8ee63d.png" width="1253" height="648" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>No difference at all in the memory consumption, by the gateway.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp3-memory-769d10a88790ea58ca00a995effcfa7c.png" width="628" height="306" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In the records we can also again see that yield increase, and timeouts have been decreased.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp3-records-bf6c88f09631f951d4d272c346ee7768.png" width="1257" height="686" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Experiment three worked as expected. <!-- -->✅</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="several-further-experiments">Several further experiments<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#several-further-experiments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Several further experiments" title="Direct link to Several further experiments">​</a></h2>
<p>We did several further experiments where we scaled the workers, played with the completion delay, reduced the starter load etc. At some point, we reached a state size that was too big (~2 Gig) such that this impacted our processing. We had to drain the cluster and stop the starters completely.</p>
<p>Interestingly was that when we reduced the completion delay, we just had a slight increase in completion, when we scaled down the workers (marked with the annotation in the graph), to reduce activations, we saw no difference.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp6-general-f35222d6e1d66526ef6eb07c53f10923.png" width="1258" height="646" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Only when we hit a certain threshold in RocksDb (it seems to be at least), the completion went up by a lot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp6-state-f33212be78503a223b0741b9d7a340e1.png" width="615" height="304" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is because the record processing latency was heavily reduced (likely the commit latency or iteration latency in RocksDb).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp6-latency-0b30edf17db48cf5d056bafe677cced4.png" width="1259" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>We wanted to understand and experiment with the impact of a slow worker on different process instances.</p>
<p>To see such an impact in our metrics we had to patch our current execution metrics, such that includes the BPMN processId, so we can differentiate between execution times of different processes.</p>
<p>See the related branch for more details <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/ck-latency-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ck-latency-metrics</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, a new process model was added <code>slow-task.bpm</code> and new deployments to create such instances and work on them. The process model was similar to the benchmark model, only the job type has been changed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected-3">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#expected-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>To verify was that whether a slow worker would impact other instances, this was uncertain territory we were hitting.</p>
<p>To be honest we expected it would affect them.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual-3">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#actual-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>We started the benchmark (default configs for broker and gateway), with additional configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>benchmark starter with 75 PI/s rate</li>
<li>3 benchmark worker (60 capacity) and completion delay of 50 ms</li>
<li>slow-task starter with 75 PI/s rate</li>
<li>3 slow-worker (60 capacity) and a completion delay of 50 ms (at the begin)</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/slow-exp-base-ea8adfd10aa658d81ca76a4c342f5df7.png" width="2539" height="871" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see based on the metrics that the execution latency is the same for both process instances, and we are able to complete our 150 PI/s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/slow-exp-base-general-25e62c9332f1ecad2df0cb8253bb188d.png" width="1894" height="644" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We slowed now the worker for the type <code>slow-task</code> down to a completion delay of 2500ms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/slow-exp-slow-worker-2500ms-records-388a523821cc584224d95d43b30c8c6d.png" width="1694" height="682" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see that we start to get <code>Job.YIELD</code> commands from the gateway, and we can see that the process instance execution is slowed down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/slow-exp-slow-worker-2500ms-9c93bc66fc1f410535f45a170ba6b96a.png" width="2544" height="875" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Interestingly that is only for the affected process instance, which we wanted to validate/verify.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reasoning">Reasoning<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#reasoning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reasoning" title="Direct link to Reasoning">​</a></h3>
<p>Our first assumption was that both instance latencies would be impacted, because are writing YIELD commands, instead of being able to complete them.</p>
<p>But another consequence comes into play. If fewer jobs are worked on, there are also fewer jobs completed, this means fewer process instances have to be continued (with batch processing until the end).</p>
<p>This means a load of yield underweights the normal load of job completions, with additional process instance continuation. That was an interesting insight for us.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="result">Result<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/30/Job-push-overloading#result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Result" title="Direct link to Result">​</a></h2>
<p>Right now it seems that even if we have a slow worker it doesn't impact badly the general system, and only affects the corresponding process instance, not other instances.</p>
<p>What we should or need to investigate further what if the job completion delay is much larger than the timeout. This is something we might want to test soon.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, we want to experiment with hot backups in SaaS and a larger runtime state in Zeebe and how it impacts the ongoing processing in Zeebe (or not?). This is part of the investigation of a recently created bug issue we wanted to verify/reproduce <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14696</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> We were able to prove that hot backups are indeed not impacting overall processing throughput in Zeebe. We found that having a full Elasticsearch disk might impact or even fail your backups, which is intransparent to the user.</p>

<p>For the experiment, we have set up a Camunda SaaS cluster (G3-M configuration), and run the <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/main/benchmarks/setup/cloud-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud benchmark</a> workload against it. During the experiment, we will run a stable load, which will cause to increase in the runtime state. We will create/initiate in different stages backups to verify the impact on processing depending on state size.</p>
<p>We kept the starter rate (creation of process instance 100 PI/s) but reduced the worker capacity and replicas.</p>

<p>Hot backups were built with the premise of not disrupting the processing throughput in Zeebe, which is why we define the following hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>Creating hot backups should not impact Zeebe's <em>processing throughput <em>no</em> matter how</em> large the runtime state is in Zeebe.</p>

<p>What is unclear to me is that it looks like we only took a backup of partition two. This needs to be further investigated, it might be also that the metrics are just confusing since it is resetting after the pod restarts.<!-- -->🐛</p>

<p>Here we come into struggle after running the load on the cluster for quite some time we reached a runtime state size of ~1 gig. Furthermore, we filled our Elasticsearch disk tremendously.</p>

<p>At this time we were no longer able to successfully create backups. Here I tried it first without interacting with the cluster. It failed after 1.5 hours, which is potentially the timeout.</p>

<p>The backup failed, because of elastic was full.</p>

<p>After cleaning the Elasticsearch we retried taking a backup again. At this step, we already reached a runtime state of ~1.25G for each partition, which is quite huge.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="result-4">Result<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/11/07/Hot-backups-impact-on-processing#result-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Result" title="Direct link to Result">​</a></h5>

<p>What we can see based on the times it is likely that it here timed out again. Taking a look at the metrics we see that a backup was processed in Zeebe.</p>
<p>It had no impact on the ongoing processing throughput.</p>

<p>At a later stage, we tried another backup with ~1.45G of runtime state even here we were not able to observe any issues related to the impact on processing throughput.</p>

<p>✅<!-- --> We were able to prove that even on a large runtime state there is no observable impact on processing throughput in Zeebe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have seen that having a large Elastic state (almost full disk) will impact taking backups and is likely to fail them. We might need to iterate here, whether we want to tune the backup strategy, give elastic more space when taking backups, or adjust watermarks, etc.</p>

<p>We have to investigate the marking of failed backups, whether it is because of a timeout in the Operator or whether these backups are failed. It looks to me like they are marked as failed, even if they may succeed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the completed backups seem to be misleading and are reset which causes inconsistent views.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New day new chaos. <!-- -->💀<!-- --> In today's chaos day I want to pick up a topic, which had bothered people for long time. I created a <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2020/07/16/big-multi-instance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos day three years ago</a> around this topic as well.</p>
<p>Today, we experiment with large multi-instances again. In the recent patch release <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.2.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8.2.5</a> we fixed an issue with spawning larger multi instances. Previously if you have created a process instance with a large multi-instance it was likely that this caused to blacklist the process instance, since the multi-instance spawning ran into <code>maxMessageSize</code> limitations.</p>
<p>This means the process instance was stuck and was no longer executable. In Operate this was not shown and caused a lot of friction or confusion to users. With the recent fix, Zeebe should chunk even large collections into smaller batches to spawn/execute the multi-instance without any issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> We were able to see that even large multi-instances can be executed now. <!-- -->✅<!-- --> At some point, we experienced performance regressions (during creating new multi-instance elements) but the execution of the process instance doesn't fail anymore. One problem at a time, we will likely investigate further to improve the performance of such a use case.</p>
<p>When we reached the <code>maxMessageSize</code> we got a rejection, if the input collection is too large we see some weird unexpected errors from NGINX.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/06/02/Using-Large-Multi-Instance#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>We do regularly game days in Camunda, and for such we also create projects to make incidents, etc. reproducible. In today's chaos day, I will reuse some code created by <a href="https://github.com/saig0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philipp Ossler</a>, thanks for that :bow: Since we mimic in such game days customers, the process is a bit more complex than necessary for such chaos day, but I will keep it like that.</p>

<p>The input collection <code>items</code>, which is used in the multi-instance is generated via:</p>

<p>In the following experiment, we will play around with the <code>size</code> value.</p>
<p>For the experiment, we will use a Camunda 8 SaaS cluster with the generation <code>Zeebe 8.2.5</code> (G3-S).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/06/02/Using-Large-Multi-Instance#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>When creating a process instance with a large collection, we expect based on the recent bug fix that the multi-instance creation is batched and created without issues.</p>
<p>One limiting factor might be the <code>maxMessageSize</code> with regard to the input collection, but in this case, I would expect that the creation of the process instance is already rejected before.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/06/02/Using-Large-Multi-Instance#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>Between the following experiments, I always recreated the clusters, to reduce the blast radius and better understand and isolate the impact.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starting-small-20k">Starting small (20k)<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/06/02/Using-Large-Multi-Instance#starting-small-20k" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starting small (20k)" title="Direct link to Starting small (20k)">​</a></h4>
<p>In previous versions, the multi-instance creation failed already quite early. For example in the game day reproducer project, we had a collection defined with <code>20.000</code> items, which we are now reusing for the start.</p>
<p>The creation of the process instance worked without any issues. We can observe in Operate the incremental creation of sub-process instances, which is great.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="incremental-creation-20k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/20k-operate-inc-b0e507b77799c7f950ff444259c8341f.png" width="1757" height="868" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see in the metrics that batch processing is limited by only 2-4 commands in a batch. That is an interesting fact that might explain why it takes a while until all instances of the multi-instance sub-process are created. We can even see rollbacks during batch processing, visible in the "Number of batch processing retries" panel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="processing-metrics-20k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/20k-processing-metrics-f3f057027ec451f9024d242df2d1bef6.png" width="1894" height="755" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The processing queue seems to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>After a while, we can see that all 20k instances are created without any bigger issues. <!-- -->🚀</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="complete-20k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/20k-operate-complete-31c5d2b848c51c7b1a96e8dc6f23b5d6.png" width="1912" height="834" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It took around 10 minutes. Taking a look at the metrics again we see that in between big command batches have been created/processed, which allowed us to reduce the processing queue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="processing-metrics-20k-pt2" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/20k-processing-metrics-2-7976048beb0f6300cf5577d40f2c9f47.png" width="1896" height="762" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In between the backpressure was quite high, but after the creation of all instances, the cluster is in a healthy state again. The creation of such multi-instance worked <!-- -->✅</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="general-metrics-20k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/20k-general-metrics-a525d7f1500dac0fd03d460b849e12e4.png" width="1893" height="940" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="increase-collection-200k">Increase collection (200k)<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/06/02/Using-Large-Multi-Instance#increase-collection-200k" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Increase collection (200k)" title="Direct link to Increase collection (200k)">​</a></h4>
<p>Again, the creation of such a process instance was not a problem itself. We can observe the creation of the sub-process instances (multi-instance) in Operate, which happens incrementally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="incremental-creation-200k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/200k-operate-inc-586ee3f6c124c92cc6700df1b6213950.png" width="1905" height="871" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It takes ages until the instances are created (After 3h ~66k instances are created). Again we see here small chunks of batches, and there are also rollbacks during batch processing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="processing-metrics-200k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/200k-processing-metrics-7a21b4741eec54581b30f819b05f3de2.png" width="1881" height="753" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The processing of that partitions is in this case blocked by the multi-instance creation, we can see that on the 100% back pressure. <!-- -->❌</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="general-metrics-200k" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/200k-general-metrics-3975fc0c4c761c321194cd69598a8d11.png" width="1883" height="868" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Even after one hour, not all instances are created (not even 20k), it takes longer than before the creation of 20.000 instances.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="incremental-creation-200k-part2" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/200k-operate-inc2-8e393502149c7dc21706229b02979515.png" width="2251" height="931" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>To escalate this even more I increase the input collection again by a factor of 10 to 2 million.</p>
<p>After creation, I see as a response the following log message in my log:</p>

<p>As we have seen above we are able now to create much larger multi instances than before, with some drawbacks in performance, which needs to be investigated further.</p>
<p>When reaching a certain limit (maxMessageSize) we get a described rejection by the broker, until we reach the limit of NGINX where the description is not that optimal. Here we can and should improve further.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we want to continue with the experiment from <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/05/15/SST-Partitioning-toggle">last Chaos day</a>, but this time
with a bit more load. This should make sure that we trigger the compaction of RocksDB and cause the SST partitioning to happen, for real.</p>
<p>The reasons stay the same we want to find out whether it would be possible to enable and disable the flag/configuration without issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Today's, experiments succeeded <!-- -->🚀<!-- -->. We were able to show that even with a higher number of process instances (bigger state) we can easily disable and enable the SST partitioning flag without issues. I also got a confirmation from a RocksDb contributor that our observations are correct, and that we can easily toggle this feature without issues.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/05/19/Continuing-SST-Partitioning-toggle#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>Similar setup to the <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/05/15/SST-Partitioning-toggle#chaos-experiment">last Chaos day</a>.
Except this time we will enable Operate as well, in order to verify easily whether all instances have been completed.
Other than that we use the standard benchmark configuration, without clients.</p>
<p>The verification of the steady state will consist, of checking the readiness and healthiness of the cluster, via zbchaos and metrics. Furthermore, we will verify that we can access operate and that no instances are running. As defined in chaos engineering principles the process of a chaos experiment looks always the same, Verify the steady state, introduce chaos, and verify the steady state.</p>
<p>In our first experiment, we will enable the SST partitioning.</p>
<p><strong>First chaos action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy a process model (which contains a <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/blob/main/go-chaos/internal/bpmn/one_task.bpmn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple model</a>)</li>
<li>Start 1000 process instances (PIs), with a service task</li>
<li>Enable the SST partitioning</li>
<li>Restart the cluster, and await readiness</li>
<li>Complete the jobs (in consequence the PIs)</li>
</ul>
<p>In our second experiment, we will disable the SST partitioning again.</p>
<p><strong>Second chaos action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start 1000 process instances (PIs), with a service task</li>
<li>Disable the SST partitioning</li>
<li>Restart the cluster, and await readiness</li>
<li>Complete the jobs (in consequence the PIs)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When operating a cluster, I can enable and disable the SST partitioning without an impact on executing existing process instances. Existing PIs should still be executable and completable.</p>

<p>Looking at the metrics shows that everything looks healthy. The only weird part is the topology panel which seems to be broken.

<p>For now, we assume the dashboard has an issue and continue with the experiment.</p>
<p>We are able to access operate without issues, and see no instances yet.</p>

<p>After the verification stage, we start with our chaos action, injecting chaos into the system.
The first step is to deploy the mentioned simple process model:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$ zbchaos deploy process -v</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Connecting to zell-chaos</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Running experiment in self-managed environment.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Port forward to zell-chaos-zeebe-gateway-7bbdf9fd58-dl97j</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Successfully created port forwarding tunnel</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Deploy file bpmn/one_task.bpmn (size: 2526 bytes).</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Deployed process model bpmn/one_task.bpmn successful with key 2251799813685249.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Deployed given process model , under key 2251799813685249!</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This is then as well visible in operate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="operate-process" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/operate-process-c2f4b5eac01d3b5334749518b3ed7eed.png" width="1091" height="503" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As the next step, we will create 1000 process instances of our simple process model, with one service task.
For that, we can <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/tree/zell-chaos-create-count-of-instances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use a new functionality</a> of <code>zbchaos</code> I built for this chaos day.</p>
<p>On the first try, I had smaller issues, with timeouts etc.</p>

<p>We have seen that even when we toggle the SST partitioning, we are able to make progress and our stored data is not impacted. This is a great out come since it means we can easily enable such configuration on existing clusters and gains the performance benefits for larger states as we have seen in previous benchmarks.</p>
<p>I have posted a question related to this topic in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rocksdb/c/Ys-yZIznZwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RocksDb google group</a> and I got a private answer which contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partitioner is just a hinter when compaction should split the file. Default compaction is also splitting by file size. So it has no functional effect and you can change configuration anytime.</p>
<p>Partitioner does not need to be simple prefix only, but one can use more complicated strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This confirms our observation and makes it much more trustworthy.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On this chaos day I wanted to experiment with a new experimental feature we have released recently. The <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/12483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enablement of the partitioning of the SST files in RocksDB</a>. This is an experimental feature from RocksDb, which we made available now for our users as well, since we have seen great benefits in performance, especially with larger runtime data.</p>
<p>I wanted to experiment a bit with the SST partitioning and find out whether it would be possible to enable and disable the flag/configuration without issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> The first experiment was successful, it looks like we can enable and disable the partitioning without impacting the execution of one existing PI. We need to experiment a bit more with larger data sets to force RocksDB compaction, to be fully sure.</p>

<p><strong>First part:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Verify steady state:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>verify the readiness of the cluster</li>
<li>deploy a process model (which contains a <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/blob/main/go-chaos/internal/bpmn/one_task.bpmn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple model</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chaos Action:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>start a process instance (PI), with a service task</li>
<li>enable the SST partitioning</li>
<li>restart the cluster</li>
<li>verify the readiness</li>
<li>verify that job is activatable</li>
<li>complete the job (in consequence the PI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second part:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos Action:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>start a process instance (PI), with a service task</li>
<li>disable the SST partitioning</li>
<li>restart the cluster</li>
<li>verify the readiness</li>
<li>verify that job is activatable</li>
<li>complete the job (in consequence the PI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When operating a cluster, I can enable the SST partitioning without an impact on executing existing process instances. Existing PIs should still be executable and completable.</p>

<p>As linked above I used again our <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/main/benchmarks/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benchmark/setup</a> scripts to set up a cluster.</p>

<p>To verify the readiness and run all actions I used the <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/tree/zbchaos-v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zbchaos</a> tool.</p>
<p>Verifying readiness is fairly easy with zbchaos.</p>

<p>When running the experiment I also observed the metrics of the cluster and was not able to see any differences in the snapshot file counts, which we would expect on the SST partitioning (there should be more files).</p>
<p>Before the experiment:

<p>After the experiment, we still see that for each partition we have around ~6 files.

<p>In order to make sure whether the options have been applied correctly I investigated the RocksDB log files and option files.</p>
<p>In the current LOG file, we can see the current options printed, which is indeed the disabled partitioner. Since this is the default as well it is not a proof yet.</p>

<p>We were able to toggle the SST partitioning flag without problems back and forth. We were able to make still progress on an existing process instance, which we wanted to prove.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we need to prove this once more for multiple process instances (100-1000 PIs), which cause or forces compaction of the SST files. Right now I'm not 100% convinced whether this experiment was enough, but it was a good first step.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today's chaos day, we wanted to experiment with the gateway and resiliency of workers.</p>
<p>We have seen in recent weeks some issues within our benchmarks when gateways have been restarted,
see <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/11975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#11975</a>.</p>
<p>We did a similar experiment <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS">in the past</a>,
today we want to focus on self-managed (<a href="https://helm.camunda.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benchmarks with our helm charts</a>).
Ideally, we can automate this as well soon.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://github.com/npepinpe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas</a> joined me on the chaos day <!-- -->🎉</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> We were able to show that the workers (clients) can reconnect after a gateway is shutdown <!-- -->✅<!-- -->
Furthermore, we have discovered a potential performance issue on lower load, which impacts process execution latency (<a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/12311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#12311</a>).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/04/06/gateway-termination#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>We will use our <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/benchmark-helm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeebe benchmark helm charts</a> to set up the test cluster, and
our helper scripts <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/main/benchmarks/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup">Setup:<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/04/06/gateway-termination#setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setup:" title="Direct link to Setup:">​</a></h3>
<p>We will run with the default benchmark configuration, which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>three brokers</li>
<li>three partitions</li>
<li>replication count three</li>
<li>two gateways</li>
</ul>
<p>We will run the benchmark with a low load, 10 process instances per second created and completed. For that,
we deploy one starter and worker. This reduces the blast radius and allows us to observe more easily how the workers
behave when a gateway is restarted.</p>
<p>During the experiment, we will use our <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/main/monitor/grafana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grafana dashboard</a> to
observe to which gateway the worker will connect and which gateway we need to stop/restart.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/04/06/gateway-termination#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>When we terminate a gateway to which the worker has connected, <strong>we expect</strong> that the worker connects to the different
replica and starts completing jobs again.</p>
<p>The performance drop is expected to be not significant, or at least should recover fast.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/04/06/gateway-termination#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>We will run the experiment in two ways, first via terminating the gateway (using <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/releases/tag/zbchaos-v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zbchaos</a>)
and later via scaling down the gateway deployment to one replica.</p>
<p>We want to verify whether this makes any difference, since terminating will cause Kubernetes to recreate immediately the pod.</p>

<p>In the metrics, we can see that due to the restart, the throughput slightly dropped, but recovered pretty fast. The worker
was able to connect to the different gateway. <!-- -->✅</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>In the panel <code>Pod Restarts</code> on the top right, we don't see any restarts and that is something
we should always be aware of that the <em>metrics are just samples of data</em>. If a pod, like a gateway, restarts fast enough
and the metric collect interval is higher (per default we have ~30 s (?)) then you might not see a change.</em></p>

<p>As described earlier we wanted to verify whether it makes a difference if we scale down the replica instead of terminating/restarting
it, which causes restarting a new pod (which might get the same IP).</p>
<p>For scaling down Nicolas found this annotation: <code>controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost</code></p>
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/#pod-deletion-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That annotation allows giving hints to the schedule which pod to turn-down, because another pod might have a higher cost
to be deleted (this is of course best-effort).</a></p>
<p>This means we edit one pod and gave the following annotation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>During the experiment I learned that when you have deployed a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deployment</a>, you need to scale down the deployment, not the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReplicaSet</a>.
Otherwise your Kubernetes deployment controller will recreate the ReplicaSet in the next reconcile loop, which means you
will have again the same replicas as defined in the deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So correct is to scale down the deployment (!), if you ever wonder.</p>

<p>With that, we have only one gateway pod left, and all traffic goes to that gateway. Based on the metrics
we can see that the workers recovered everytime when we restarted/terminated or scaled down.</p>

<p>During checking the metrics together with Nicolas, we realized that even on low load (10 PI/s) we have high spikes
in our processing execution latency.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="latency" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/latency-9fda0fdb0283c3af3831aef3813997e6.png" width="1852" height="822" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The spikes are going up to 1-1.5 seconds, while the avg is at 0.06s. This happens every 6 minutes.</p>
<p>We can see that the commit latency is as well at the same time high, which might be an issue because of the high IO.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="commit" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/commit-541f81ca663ae80835fa6ef8357d94a7.png" width="1841" height="250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We first expected that to be related to snapshotting, but snapshots happen much more often.</p>

<p>Interestingly is that it seems to be related to our segment creation (again), even if we have
async segment creation in our journal built recently. We need to investigate this further within <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/12311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#12311</a>.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/11416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batch processing</a> was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Chaos experiment failed. <!-- -->💥<!-- --> Batch processing doesn't seem to respect the configured limit, which causes issues with processing and influences the health of the system. We found a bug <!-- -->💪</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2023/02/23/Recursive-call-activity#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>In today's chaos experiment, we want to experiment with <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/11416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batch processing</a> and how it can handle error conditions, like deploying an endless recursive process model.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="recursive process" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/call-8d5375c7dcbd4d2e36d20706dd178d3d.png" width="903" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>When we deploy such a process model and create an instance of it, we expect that the execution is done endlessly. In normal process models with batch processing, the execution of a process instance is done until a wait state is reached. In this process model, there exists no wait state. To handle such cases, we have implemented a batch limit, which can be configured via <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/dist/src/main/config/broker.standalone.yaml.template#L695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maxCommandsInBatch</a>. This configuration is by default set to 100 commands. Meaning the stream processor will process 100 commands until it stops, to make room for other things.</p>
<p>We expect that our limit handling steps in during the execution and we can execute also other instances or, cancel the problematic process instance. Furthermore, we expect to stay healthy, we should be able to update our health check continuously.</p>

<p>Before we can start with our experiment we need to start our benchmark Zeebe cluster. This has become easier now since I have written the last post. Previously we had to use the scripts and Makefile in the <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/tree/main/benchmarks/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe/benchmark sub-directory</a>.</p>
<p>We have now provided new <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/benchmark-helm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmark Helm charts</a>, based on our Camunda Platform Helm charts. They allow us to deploy a new zeebe benchmark setup via:</p>

<p>After creating the instance we can observe the behavior of the Zeebe via <a href="https://grafana.dev.zeebe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grafana</a>.</p>
<p>We can see that the processing starts immediately quite high and is continuously going on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="general" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/general-96c61dbea3faf18172737f97412ce400.png" width="1842" height="421" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>We have two instances running, one on partition three and one on partition one.</strong></p>
<p><em>One interesting fact is that the topology request rate is also up to 0.400 per second, so potentially every 2.5 seconds we send a topology request to the gateway. But there is no application deployed that does this. <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/11599#discussion_r1109846523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have recently found out again</a>, that we have the Zeebe client usage in the gateway to request the topology. Might be worth investigating whether this is an issue.</em></p>
<p>After observing this cluster for a while we can see that after around five minutes the cluster fails. The processing for the partitions breaks down to 1/10 of what was processed before. A bit later it looks like it tries to come back but, failed again.</p>

<p>Interesting insights we can get in our new Batch processing metrics. We see that at the beginning we use our limit of 100 commands per batch, but soon as we start with the recursion we use an enormous high batch processing command count.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="fail-batchprocessing.png" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/fail-batchprocessing-1db16026a70bf497036fdaf1df98bf26.png" width="1829" height="552" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The new sequence metric shows similar results, so there must be a problem with not respecting the limit.</p>

<p>With this, I mark this chaos experiment as failed. We need to investigate this further and fix the related issue.<!-- -->💥</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last weeks, we made several changes in our core components, we introduce some new abstractions, and changed how we communicate between partitions.</p>
<p>Due to these changes, we thought it might make sense to run some more chaos experiments in that direction and area since our benchmarks also recently found some interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>Today we experimented with Message Correlation and what happens when a network partition disturbs the correlation process.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> The experiment was partially successful (after retry), we were able to publish messages during a network partition that have been correlated after the network partition. We need to verify whether we can also publish messages before a network partition and during the partition create the related instances.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/31/Message-Correlation-after-Network-Partition#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>The experiment is related to our previously described <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/02/deployment-distribution">deployment distribution experiment</a>.</p>
<p>When a user/client publishes a message, the message will be sent to a certain partition, based on the correlation key. There is some calculation going on related to the hashcode and the partition count.
This calculation is deterministic in order to find later the message again if we reach a message catch event.</p>
<p>A message can specify a time-to-live (TTL), <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/messages/#message-buffering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which allows buffering that message</a>. If later a process instance is created and the TTL is not exceeded the message can be still correlated. The creation of process instances
happens round-robin on the existing/available partitions (this is controlled by the gateway). When a process instance is created and reaches a message catch event it will be based on the correlation key search for a message on the expected partition. <em>Actually this happens based on subscriptions, for more details see the <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/messages/#message-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/enhancements/blob/master/ZEP004-wf-stream-processing.md#message-intermediate-catch-event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZEP-4</a>.</em> If the message still exists (TTL didn't expire) and this message <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/messages/#message-cardinality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn't already correlated to the same process definition</a> then it will be correlated.</p>
<p>Since both partitions can be on different leader nodes this requires some network communication, which can be interrupted/disturbed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/31/Message-Correlation-after-Network-Partition#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>We expect that if the network between the partition where the message was published and where the process instance was created is interrupted that no message correlation happens. But after the network recovers, we expect further that the message will be correlated and the process instance can continue.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/31/Message-Correlation-after-Network-Partition#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>As a setup, I installed our benchmarks, with Operate enabled.
This allows us to also view the details in Operate.</p>

<p>During the experiment, it turned out that the <code>podSecurityContext</code> is outdated.</p>

<p>Since we want to automate this experiment soon, or later I thought it would be a good idea to use the <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/process-instance-creation/#create-and-await-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create process instance with result</a>. We would start the following process:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="msg-catch" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/msg-catch-dba2526317c719b66db25ef1dfaff2a4.png" width="723" height="207" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Before we start the process we need to publish the message to a certain partition and create a network partition between two partitions. After that, we can create the PI and verify that the message correlation shouldn't happen. Afterward, we would delete the network partition and verify that the process instance is completed.</p>

<p>To make the experiment easier to reproduce and allow us to experiment in different directions later as well I extend our new chaos cli (zbchaos), which I created during the last hack days. I will write a separate blog post about this tool soon.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="message-publish">Message Publish<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/31/Message-Correlation-after-Network-Partition#message-publish" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Message Publish" title="Direct link to Message Publish">​</a></h5>
<p>I added a new feature (<a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/pull/166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR #166</a>) that allows us to publish a message to a specific partition:</p>

<p>For the steady-state verification, multiple enhancements have been added.</p>
<ol>
<li>Previously the <code>zbchaos</code> didn't allow us to create instances of specific models, which is now added as new feature (<a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/pull/167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR #167</a>).</li>
<li>In order to await the process instance completion a new flag was added <code>--awaitResult</code>, which allows us to await the PI completeness.</li>
<li>To make sure that our message can be correlated we have to set the right correlationKey/value. This means we need to create instances with certain variables, which is now possible as well (<code>--variables</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>We can see that the leaders are well distributed. I pick partition 3 as our message publish partition, and partition 1 as our partition for the process instance. Since we can't control really the round-robin mechanism, we need to create multiple messages and multiple process instances (for each partition). During our experiment, we will only look at the instance on partition one.</p>

<p>And got a similar exception. Taking a look at Operate we can see that process instances are created. It is likely that the await timed out since the message hasn't been correlated but the returned error is a bit unclear. Interesting is that on partition two the message is also not correlated.</p>

<ul>
<li>I learned that the go zeebe client, doesn't set a default TTL which was interesting to find out (and somehow unexpected).</li>
<li>The zbchaos uses always the same port for connecting to the kubernetes and zeebe cluster, which makes it impossible to run multiple commands. We should use random ports to make this possible.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We encountered recently a severe bug <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#9877</a> and I was wondering why we haven't spotted it earlier, since we have chaos experiments for it. I realized two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The experiments only check for parts of it (BPMN resource only). The production code has changed, and a new feature has been added (DMN) but the experiments/tests haven't been adjusted.</li>
<li>More importantly we disabled the automated execution of the deployment distribution experiment because it was flaky due to a missing standalone gateway in Camunda Cloud SaaS <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos#61</a>. This is no longer the case, see <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS">Standalone Gateway in CCSaaS</a></li>
</ol>
<p>On this chaos day I want to bring the automation of this chaos experiment back to life. If I have still time I want to enhance the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> The experiment still worked, and our deployment distribution is still resilient against network partitions. It also works with DMN resources. I can enable the experiment again, and we can close <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos#61</a>. Unfortunately, we were not able to reproduce <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#9877</a> but we did some good preparation work for it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/02/deployment-distribution#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>To recap, when a deployment is created by a client it is sent to the partition one leader. Partition one is in charge of distributing the deployment to the other partitions. That means it will send the deployment to the other partition leaders, this is retried as long no ACK was received from the corresponding partition leader.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="deploymentDistribution" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/deploymentDistribution-d300fff30d9d6cab27d9fe01c6504cd4.png" width="871" height="491" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We already have covered that in more detail in another chaos day you can read <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/01/26/deployments">here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/02/deployment-distribution#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>

<p>As you can see in the image we will create an asymmetric network partition and disconnect the partition one leader from partition three. That means the sending to partition three will not be possible. We use here an asymmetric network partition, in order to reduce the probability to cause a leader change. The partition one leader is a follower of partition three and will still receive heartbeats.</p>
<p>After disconnecting the leaders we deploy multiple process versions and after connecting the leaders again we expect that the deployments are distributed. It is expected that we can create instances of the last version on all partitions.</p>
<p>We will run the existing experiment against the latest minor version, to verify whether the experiment still works. When we enable the experiment again for automation it will be executed against SNAPSHOT automatically.</p>

<p>As a first step, we created a new Production-S cluster, which has three partitions, three nodes (brokers), and two standalone gateways. The Zeebe version was set to 8.0.4 (latest minor).</p>
<p>It was a while since I used the <a href="https://chaostoolkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaostoolkit</a> which is the reason I had to reinstall it again, which is quite a simple see <a href="https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the deployment distribution was not enabled for Production-S clusters, which is currently the only configuration we test via <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-cluster-testbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeebe Testbench</a>. We have to use the experiment that is defined under <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/tree/master/chaos-workers/chaos-experiments/camunda-cloud/production-l/deployment-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">production-l/deployment-distribution</a>, which is the same*.</p>
<sub>* That is not 100% true. During running the Production-l experiment I realized that it made some assumptions regarding the <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/blob/master/chaos-workers/chaos-experiments/scripts/disconnect-leaders-one-way.sh#L19">partition count</a> which needs to be adjusted for the Production-S setup.</sub>

<p>Based on the tool output it looks like it succeed, to make sure it really worked, we will take a look at the logs in stackdriver.</p>
<p>In the following logs we can see that deployment distribution is failing for partition 3 and is retried, which is expected and what we wanted.</p>

<p>At some point, the retry stopped, and we can see in the experiment output that we were able to start process instances on all partitions. This is great because it means the experiment was successfully executed and our deployment distribution is failure tolerant.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhancement">Enhancement<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/02/deployment-distribution#enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhancement" title="Direct link to Enhancement">​</a></h4>
<p>As described earlier the current experiment deploys a BPMN process model only. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="v1" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/multiVersionModel-bae5089e350bb8e3ef1f11b3e01be25c.png" width="999" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In order to make DMN part of the experiment, we change the service task to a <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/business-rule-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Rule task</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="v2" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/multiVersionModelv2-7fa903fb40c6a640222206e5922de001.png" width="999" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The decision is really simple and just defines a static input and returns that as output.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="decision" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/decision-3e1b9db140fbc19b0250ee1fd804a33d.png" width="1213" height="471" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When we run our experiment and create process instances on all partitions the DMN needs to be available otherwise the execution would fail. Currently, we can't specify a specific version of the DMN in the Business Rule Task (always the latest will be executed). Because of that, we will not deploy different DMN model versions, since it is currently not that easy to verify whether the right version was chosen.</p>
<p>After adjusting the model and adjusting the script, we run the experiment again.</p>

<p>It succeeded as well.</p>
<p>Taking a look at Operate we can see some incidents.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="dmn-error" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/dmn-error-422b88cf3273e715c442c76ecce338d9.png" width="1000" height="175" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It seems the process instance execution runs into the Business Rule Task, but the DMN resource was not available on the partition.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="dmn-retry" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/dmn-retry-665320690997b2566a40ac99505a2f84.png" width="2528" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>After retrying in Operate the incident was resolved, which means the DMN resource was distributed at that time.</p>
<p>We can adjust the experiment further to await the result of the process execution, but I will stop here and leave that for a later point.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reproduce-our-bug">Reproduce our bug<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/08/02/deployment-distribution#reproduce-our-bug" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reproduce our bug" title="Direct link to Reproduce our bug">​</a></h4>
<p>The current experiment didn't reproduce the bug in <a href="https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#9877</a>, since the DMN resource has to be distributed multiple times. Currently, we create a network partition such that the distribution doesn't work at all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/deploymentDistributionExperimentV2-271448cf9bf1690fc24acdd0f89581d9.png" width="933" height="515" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In order to reproduce our scenario, we can set the network partition in the other direction, such that the acknowledgment is not received by the leader one.</p>
<p>Adjusting the experiment (script) like this:</p>

<p>Should do the trick, but I was not yet able to reproduce the issue with 8.0.4. It seems we need to spend some more time reproducing the bug. But I think with today's changes we already did a good step in the right direction, and we can improve based on that. I will create a follow-up issue to improve our experiment.</p>

<p>Based on today's outcome we can enable again the Deployment Distribution experiment for Production-S, such that is executed by Zeebe Testbench (our automation tooling). We can close <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos#61</a></p>
<p>We should adjust our Chaos Worker implementation such that we also deploy DMN resources as we did in today's Chaos Day, since the scripts we changed aren't used in the automation.</p>
<p>I will create a follow-up issue to improve our experiment, so we can reproduce the critical bug.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently introduced the Zeebe Standalone Gateway in CCSaaS. Today I wanted to do a first simple
chaos experiment with the gateway, where we just restart one gateway.</p>
<p>Ideally in the future we could enable some gateway chaos experiments again, which we currently only support for <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/tree/master/chaos-workers/chaos-experiments/helm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Our Camunda Cloud clusters can handle gateway restarts without issues.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>This experiment is a simple restart / kill pod experiment. We want to verify that our cluster
can still make progress even if a gateway is restarted / killed in between. Currently, we are running two gateway replicas in the CCSaaS.</p>
<p>In order to start with our experiment we created a new CCSaaS cluster with a <code>Production - S</code> plan, and the latest version (1.3.4).
To run some load on the cluster we used the cloud benchmark deployments, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/tree/main/benchmarks/setup/cloud-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
The load was rather low with ~ 100 PI/s.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p><em>Hypothesis: When restarting / killing a zeebe standalone gateway we expect only a small
impact on current requests, new requests should be routed to the right gateway and the cluster can
make progress.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>After creating the cluster and starting the benchmark we checked the current resource usage, to find a cluster which does most of the work. It looks like that the requests are well distributed.</p>

<p>We can see that the throughput goes almost directly down, but recovers again. It took ~4 min until we
reached the normal state (normal throughput of 100 PI/s) again. But we can also see that it is only a short period
of time, where nothing happens.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/restart2-a5fd3b37472ebf79e5edac7f1ed513e5.png" width="1828" height="685" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Ideally we would define some anti-affinity on the gateway pods, to reduce the risk of losing all gateways at once.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="result">Result<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/15/Standalone-Gateway-in-CCSaaS#result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Result" title="Direct link to Result">​</a></h2>
<p>We were able to verify and proof our hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hypothesis: When restarting / killing a zeebe standalone gateway we expect only a small
impact on current requests, new requests should be routed to the right gateway and the cluster can
make progress.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw above the resources were almost equally used, which is in our normal zeebe benchmarks not the case.
In the benchmarks we use the helm charts and there is no ingress controller enabled,
so we have no good load balancing of the incoming requests.</p>
<p>The benefit of the standalone gateway now stands out: losing one is not too problematic than one broker with an embedded gateway,
since a broker takes longer to restart and is likely to be an leader for a partition, which will then also cause a leader change.
Furthermore, we can scale the gateways independently.</p>

<p>During experiment with the CCSaaS cluster I observed that the Optimize importer was crashlooping due to this load (PI 100/s).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> The chaos experiment succeeded <!-- -->💪<!-- --> We were able to prove our hypothesis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/01/High-Snapshot-Frequency#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snapshot-interval">Snapshot Interval<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/01/High-Snapshot-Frequency#snapshot-interval" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Snapshot Interval" title="Direct link to Snapshot Interval">​</a></h3>
<p>As we can see in the <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/resource-planning/#snapshots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a> a snapshot is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A snapshot is a projection of all events that represent the current running state of the processes running on the partition. It contains all active data, for example, deployed processes, active process instances, and not yet completed jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Per default snapshots are taken every 5 minutes, by leaders and followers. If a follower is lagging behind (with replication) the leader will, after reaching a certain threshold, prefer to send the follower a snapshot instead of replicating X amount of records. We recently observed that this currently happens quite often, see <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/8565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#8565</a>.</p>
<p>The snapshot interval can be changed via an environment variable: <code>ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_SNAPSHOTPERIOD</code></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/01/High-Snapshot-Frequency#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>We expect that even if the snapshot interval is low (so the frequency of taking snapshot is high) we not run into any availability issues and the cluster should still be healthy. Lower snapshot interval might impact the performance, since taking a snapshot can take some time but other than that it shouldn't have any effect.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/02/01/High-Snapshot-Frequency#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>As usual, we run again two benchmarks to compare them. One base which has the <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/tree/develop/benchmarks/setup/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default benchmark configuration</a> and one with a changed snapshot interval.</p>
<p>For the second benchmark we set the snapshot interval to one minute. Like this:</p>

<p>Throughput wise we can see a small difference, but this might be more related that on the base benchmark one node is leader for all partitions.</p>

<p>In general the cluster with the small snapshot interval shows no negative effect. What we can see is that the install request rate increased. It seems to be currently have no affect, but it is likely that if more partitions are added it might become an issue.</p>

<p>In order to verify how Zeebe reacts on a bigger snapshot interval we have set the interval to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>In general, it looked good. What we can see is that one node was restarted in between and took a while to come back.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/big-general-799179b5b7dc76032320f1a31488778f.png" width="1840" height="986" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is expected due to the high snapshot interval, but interesting to observe. The leader had no snapshot yet produced, which means it had to replicate all events to the restarted follower. Only if the follower catches up on all partitions its bootstrap process is complete, and it can mark itself as ready. As we see it can take a while if there is no snapshot available, since new records are incoming all the time.</p>
<p>After the leader of partition two took a snapshot and the leader sent this snapshot to the follower, the follower were able to become ready.</p>
<p>Even with a big snapshot interval we can see that as soon as a new snapshot is taken it is sent to the followers, which is suboptimal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/big-install-freq-ec4ff83707c476e44d9469cc1969b106.png" width="2472" height="274" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>An important thing to keep in mind when playing around with snapshots is the logstream/journal size. The journal is only compacted after taking a snapshot, if we take snapshot less frequent this means we clean up less frequent. The log can grow much bigger with big snapshot intervals.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/big-interval-log-84637b403e2e447d914fbf9fc386e164.png" width="1219" height="295" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>This time I wanted to experiment with "big" variables. Zeebe supports a <code>maxMessageSize</code> of 4 MB, which is quite big. In general, it should be clear that using big variables will cause performance issues, but today I also want to find out whether the system can handle big variables (~1 MB) at all.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> Our Chaos experiment failed! Zeebe and Camunda Cloud is not able to handle (per default) big variables (~1 MB) without issues.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>Normally we run our benchmarks with ~32 KB payload size. This time we want to try out a payload size of ~1 MB and verify whether the system can handle such payload sizes. The payload we use can be found <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big_payload.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The benchmark setup, is similar to default Zeebe benchmarks you can find <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/tree/develop/benchmarks/setup/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To make it work and fair we updated the starter and worker resources for both, base and the chaos cluster.</p>

<p>It is expected that the performance will drop, we formulate the following hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis: With a bigger payload size of e.g. 1 MB, Zeebe should be still able to handle process instances, maybe under a degraded performance, but in general the availability must not suffer from such a payload size.</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>

<p>We started a base benchmark with ~32 KB to verify how it looks like normally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="base" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/base-general-6f2d98f4e1437e7d6ccaeb9106e1ad4e.png" width="1838" height="912" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>In order to verify how Zeebe handles different payload, we first started with a small payload ~130 bytes, which is part of the Starter application (called <code>small_payload.json</code>).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="small-payload" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/small-payload-7275166d05a6c32e2a0e7d86125f3c44.png" width="1835" height="910" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see that the system handles such payload without any issues, and we can reach ~190 process instances per second (PI/s).</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="big-payload">Big Payload<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#big-payload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Big Payload" title="Direct link to Big Payload">​</a></h4>
<p>After running with a small payload, we changed the payload to a size of ~1 MB. This immediately broke the standalone gateways.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="big-payload" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/big-payload-starter-gw-restarts-18e517c14c161d58190bd23b618b87cf.png" width="1835" height="904" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The gateways went out of memory (OOM) in a loop. No processing was made in this time.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="increasing-resources">Increasing Resources<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#increasing-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Increasing Resources" title="Direct link to Increasing Resources">​</a></h5>
<p>In order to continue the experiment and to verify how Zeebe itself can handle it, we increased the gateway resources.</p>

<p>But this doesn't help. The gateway went no longer OOM, but it was still not able to handle the payload.</p>

<p>We can see that in a short period of time some events have been processed (small spike in the "Current Events" panel), but this stopped quite fast again. In the gateway logs there are endless warnings:</p>

<p>On the client side we can see that the Zeebe cluster seems to be unavailable.</p>

<p>We wanted to verify how Camunda Cloud and our standard Cluster plan (GA Hardware Plan) handles such a payload. But the result was the same.</p>

<p>The processing stopped quite fast due to OOM of the gateway. We can see that operate is also not able to handle such load.</p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: With a bigger payload size of e.g. 1 MB Zeebe, should be still able to handle process instances, maybe under a degraded performance but in general the availability must not suffer from such a payload size.</em></p>

<p>We opened the following bug issues:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1>Outtakes</h1>
<p>Interesting issues I run into when doing the chaos experiment, could be count as TIL events and mentioning them might help others.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="message-pack-is-not-valid">Message pack is not valid<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#message-pack-is-not-valid" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Message pack is not valid" title="Direct link to Message pack is not valid">​</a></h2>
<p>When I first generated the JSON payload, it was an array on root level, which is not supported by Zeebe.</p>
<p>I spent sometime to understand why I see no progress in processing. Taking a look at the gateway logs we can see:</p>
<p><code>"Expected to handle gRPC request, but messagepack property was invalid: io.camunda.zeebe.msgpack.MsgpackPropertyException: Property 'variables' is invalid: Expected document to be a root level object, but was 'ARRAY'"</code></p>
<p>On the client side (if the logging is turned on, starter needs info logging) we see:</p>
<p><code>INVALID_ARGUMENT: Property 'variables' is invalid: Expected document to be a root level object, but was 'ARRAY'</code></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configure-the-starter-payload">Configure the Starter payload<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2022/01/19/big-variables#configure-the-starter-payload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configure the Starter payload" title="Direct link to Configure the Starter payload">​</a></h2>
<p>In order to use different JSON payload for the starter we support a configuration on the starter application (<code>-Dapp.starter.payloadPath</code>). I had a lot of <em>"fun"</em> to find out the right syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Dapp.starter.payloadPath="bpmn/small_payload.json" - <em>DOESN'T WORK</em></li>
<li>-Dapp.starter.payloadPath="/bpmn/small_payload.json" - <em>DOESN'T WORK</em></li>
<li>-Dapp.starter.payloadPath=/bpmn/small_payload.json - <em>DOESN'T WORK</em></li>
<li>-Dapp.starter.payloadPath=bpmn/big_payload.json - <em>WORKS</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So be aware don't use <code>"</code> and no <code>/</code> in front, otherwise you might get a <code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: "bpmn/small_payload.json" (No such file or directory)</code> in your starter deployment and wonder why you see no progress.</p>]]></content>

<p>What we can see is that if we increase the worker number it will decrease the throughput, this might be explained with the case that we sent more activation requests / commands which need to be handled by the Brokers. We can see that the back pressure is higher with 16 workers.</p>

<p>Between eight and four workers we see the expected difference, that more workers increases the throughput and we are able to complete more instances in a second. The result of 16 workers is completely unexpected. We observed that after short time frame the completion throughput completely droped, and only process instances are created.</p>
<p>We were able to reproduce this behavior, which shows the weakness again.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to some incidents and critical bugs we observed in the last weeks, I wanted to spent some time to understand the issues better and experiment how we could detect them. One of the issue we have observed was that keys were generated more than once, so they were no longer unique (<a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/8129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#8129</a>). I will describe this property in the next section more in depth.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> We were able to design an experiment which helps us to detect duplicated keys in the log. Further work should be done to automate such experiment and run it agains newer versions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unique-keys">Unique Keys<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/11/11/Not-produce-duplicate-Keys#unique-keys" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unique Keys" title="Direct link to Unique Keys">​</a></h2>
<p>In Zeebe each element must have an cluster wide unique key. This is a property we expect in several areas inside, but also outside of Zeebe (external services). We can call it an invariant we have to guarantee.</p>
<p>In order to have cluster wide unique key's we encode the partition id in the key's. You can check this <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/develop/protocol/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/protocol/Protocol.java#L71-L73" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a> for more details. Furthermore only the Leader (of a partition) are in charge and allowed to generate new keys. If a fail-over happens the new leader need to continue with generating new keys, he has to resume where the other Leader have left-of.</p>
<p>The last part was exactly the issue we had, see <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/8129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#8129</a>. The new leader generated key's, which have been already generated by the previous leader. This caused inconsistency in our internal state, but also in external services like Operate.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaos-experiment">Chaos Experiment<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/11/11/Not-produce-duplicate-Keys#chaos-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos Experiment" title="Direct link to Chaos Experiment">​</a></h2>
<p>This time it is a bit different approach, since we know it will <em>fail</em> and we want to examine how we can detect the weakness.
In order to understand how we can detect and prevent/verify that this will not happen again, I want to run an experiment against 1.2.0. Later we should try to automate this experiment and run it against newer versions.</p>
<p>As described <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/11/11/Not-produce-duplicate-Keys#unique-keys">above</a> the issue was caused due to a fail-over, to be more specific, the Follower has already reached the end of the log (replayed all events) and on fail-over he had nothing to replay. In order to reproduce this situation we will do the following experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy an simple process model, with start and end event.</li>
<li>Start an instance and await the result <code>zbctl create instance "simpleProcess" --withResult --insecure</code></li>
<li>Wait a short period of time</li>
<li>Restart the current Leader <code>k delete pod zell-chaos-zeebe-2</code></li>
<li>Wait until a new Leader is choosen</li>
<li>Start an instance and await the result <code>zbctl create instance "simpleProcess" --withResult --insecure</code></li>
</ol>
<p>After doing this we should copy the data from the new Leader and exermine the log (with <a href="https://github.com/Zelldon/zdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zdb</a>). Alternatively, we could also verify the exporter log in elastic.</p>
<p>In general it should be clear that if we take a look at the log the key can appear multiple times, but they should only reference one single entity/element.</p>
<p>A key is normally generated when processing a command and written as follow up event the first time to the log. For example when we process the <code>ACTIVATE_ELEMENT</code> command we write the key of the new entity on <code>ELEMENT_ACTIVATED</code> to the log.
Keys are assigned for other types of entities as well, like process instance creations, deployments etc. Here it works similar.</p>
<p>If the follow-up event contains a key which doesn't occurre the first time, then we have a problem, and this is how we want to detect it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/11/11/Not-produce-duplicate-Keys#expected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h3>
<p>To follow the chaos engineering approach we will define here a hypothesis, even if we know it might not true for 1.2.0. But later we can reuse it for newer version, because here it should apply.</p>
<p><em>We expect even if we processed all records and have a fail-over that the new leader should not generate the same keys again.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actual">Actual<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/11/11/Not-produce-duplicate-Keys#actual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actual" title="Direct link to Actual">​</a></h3>
<p>We started a benchmark with version 1.2.0, three brokers and one partition to reduce the scope and followed the described experiment above.</p>
<p>The second process instance creation returned a key (<code>2251799813685258</code>) which was incremented by one, compared to the other process instance (<code>2251799813685257</code>). Here we already knew that our experiment caused the issue. Because, multiple new entities are generated during processing of a process instance and we awaited the result, at the first process instance creation. This means we have generated already more than one key (on the old leader), which hasn't been picked up by the new leader.</p>
<p>We copyed the data from the new Leader and exermined the log via <code>zdb</code>. First we printed the complete log into a separate file as json:</p>

<p>This makes it human readable and also processable by other tools, like <code>jq</code>. After checking the file we already found one duplicate.</p>
<p>The first key was part of index 12 in term one and the duplicate was part of index 20 in term 2 (new leader term)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this chaos day we wanted to prove the hypothesis that the throughput should not significantly change even if we have bigger state, see <a href="https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe-chaos#64</a></p>
<p>This came up due observations from the <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/10/05/recovery-time">last chaos day</a>. We already had a bigger investigation here <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/7955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeebe#7955</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> We were not able to prove the hypothesis. Bigger state, more than 100k+ process instances in the state, seems to have an big impact on the processing throughput.</p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/10/05/recovery-time">last chaos day</a> we set up three brokers, with one partition and replication factor three.</p>
<p>As first part of the experiment we start some amount of instances, afterwards we want to complete them with our workers. Based on the <a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/10/05/recovery-time">last chaos day</a> we know what we can complete ~100 process instances with one worker and a capacity of <code>12</code>. An example worker configuration can be found <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/develop/benchmarks/setup/default/worker.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>We changed the following:</p>

<p>As first experiment we start with creating <code>100.000</code> instances, afterwards we start the worker.</p>
<p>In order to do that easily we can configure the <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/develop/benchmarks/setup/default/starter.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter</a> and reduce the rate to <code>100</code> and set the duration limit to <code>1000</code>. This means it will run for <code>1000</code> second and start each second <code>100</code> instances (which makes <code>100.000</code>).</p>

<p>We expected that we can create <code>100.000</code> instances and can complete them with a rate of <code>~100</code>, as we have seen in other experiments.</p>

<p>As second experiment we wanted to increase the state by factor <code>10</code>, which means <code>1.000.000</code> instances in the state and then start the worker.</p>
<p>In order to do that we changed the following in the starter configuration:</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expected-1">Expected<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/10/29/Throughput-on-big-state#expected-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expected" title="Direct link to Expected">​</a></h4>
<p>We expect that we can create <code>1.000.000</code> instances and can complete them with a rate of <code>~100</code>, as we have seen in other experiments.</p>

<p>We were <strong>not</strong> able to create all instances without issues.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-starting-general-90285fc89bbadf62e2171be8ded4684f.png" width="1825" height="643" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We see that at some point the throughput drops and backpressure seem to kick in. When this happens the state is only a bit bigger than in the previous experiment</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-state-4b557cf5a0c465d33ea8a378c5b93414.png" width="1838" height="878" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The running instances seem to be around ~170K at this time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-running-17d829e56e06a32e935cae47c68aeae6.png" width="1828" height="653" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see that the processing queue increased at the same time and reached a critical point (over 150 records in the backlog).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-queue-080a6c7f13f9b67e38f6c322f9d5f6fa.png" width="1827" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The overall latency seems to increase after this time (which makes sense)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/assets/images/exp2-latency-5d21d638de8b582d99853871ddf73f9f.png" width="1828" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We haven't started the workers for this experiment, since the throughput already break before.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that this is related to the state we run an experiment with the <a href="https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/develop/benchmarks/setup/default/simpleStarter.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simpleStarter</a>. This starter starts a process, which contains only a start and end event.</p>
<p>We let this starter run for more than one day and haven't experienced any issues on this one.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="result">Result<a href="https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/2021/10/29/Throughput-on-big-state#result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Result" title="Direct link to Result">​</a></h2>
<p>As written above the throughput seem to break, after we reach a certain state size.</p>
<p>It might be just a trigger to get the system into stumblling, which means: after one thing takes a bit longer the processing queue gets longer and the processor is not able to catch up any more. This causes then backpressure to kick in etc.</p>
<p>I think we need to further investigate this.</p>]]></content>
