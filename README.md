# Zeebe Chaos

In order to build confidence in our system (Zeebe) and to find issues/problems/bugs before our users do,
we started to invest in a discipline so called `Chaos Engineering`. This repository contains everything
related to that, like chaos experiments, an hypotheses backlog etc.

We encourage our users to contribute to this project as much as possible,
under consideration our [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Chaos Engineering

**Definition of Chaos Engineering:**

## Chaos Experiments

In order to test or execute chaos experiments we use an tool called [chaos-toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/), which
makes it easy to create chaos experiments and also automate them later on.

All our current experiments are located under `chaos-days/blog/`, for more 
details please have a look at the [README](chaos-days/blog/README.md).
