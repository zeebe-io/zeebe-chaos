# Chaos Day Summary

Today I had not much time for the chaos day, because of writing Gameday Summary, Incident review, taking part of incidents etc. So enough chaos for one day :)

But I wanted to merge the PR from Peter and test how our brokers behave if they are not gracefully shutdown. 
I did that on Wednesday (21-10-2020).

## PR Merge

I tried again the new chaos experiment with a Production M cluster, before merging. It worked quite smooth.
PR is merged [#41](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/pull/41) :tada:

## Non-graceful shutdown

Currently in our experiments we do a normal `kubectl delete pod`, which does an graceful shutdown. The application has time to stop it's services etc. It would be interesting how Zeebe handles non-graceful shutdowns. In order to achieve that we can use the option `--grace-period=0`. For more information you can read for example [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/#force-deletion)

I added additional experiments to our normal follower and leader restarts experiments, such that we have both graceful and non-graceful restarts.
Both seem to work without any issues. I was also able to fix some bash script error with the help of [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck). Related issue https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/42.
