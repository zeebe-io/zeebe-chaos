# Zbchaos — A new fault injection tool for Zeebe

During Summer Hackdays 2022, I worked on a project called “Zeebe chaos” (zbchaos), a fault injection CLI tool. 
This allows us engineers to more easily run chaos experiments against Zeebe, build up confidence in the system’s capabilities, 
and discover potential weaknesses.
