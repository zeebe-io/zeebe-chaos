# Chaos Day Summary

 * Run a chaos experiment without exporters

## Chaos Experiment

 We wanted to run a chaos experiment, which covers [#20](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/20).
 Furthermore, it was recently asked in the forum whether it makes a difference performance wise to run a broker without exporters, see [here](https://forum.zeebe.io/t/zeebe-low-performance/1356/17) 

### Expected

 Running Broker without exporter should work without any problems. We should be able to delete data on every snapshot interval.
 Performance wise there should be no difference. 

### Actual

 We have setup three different benchmarks:

 * default with elastic and metrics exporter enabled
 * only with metrics exporter
 * without any exporter

 These benchmarks run overnight without bigger issues. This means all of three where able to take snapshots and compact the log. This satisfy our hypothesis of https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/issues/20 .

| Default | Without exporters |
|---|---|
| ![default-pvc](/assets/2020-07-30/default-pvc.png) | ![without-exporter-pvc](/assets/2020-07-30/without-exporter-pvc.png) |

The resource consumption seem to be kind of similar, but we still see that the memory usage increases overtime. This seems to be related to [#4812](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/4812)

| Default | Metric Exporter | Without exporters |
|---|---|---|
| ![default](/assets/2020-07-30/default-resources.png) | ![metric](/assets/2020-07-30/metric-exporter-resources.png) | ![without](/assets/2020-07-30/without-exporter-resources.png) |

 Unexpected was that we see a difference in throughput. The benchmark without exporters seem to have a better throughput overall. It is able to complete ~ 30 workflow instances more per second, then the other benchmarks.

| Default | Metric Exporter | Without exporters |
|---|---|---|
| ![default](/assets/2020-07-30/default-general.png) | ![metric](/assets/2020-07-30/metric-exporter-general.png) | ![without](/assets/2020-07-30/without-exporter-general.png) |

  We compared also other benchmarks which we have currently running, e.g. a snapshot from 24-07-2020 or from the 0.24.1 release. 

| Snapshot 24-07 | Release 0.24.1 |
|---|---|
| ![snapshot](/assets/2020-07-30/snapshot-24-7-general.png) | ![release-241](/assets/2020-07-30/release-0241-general.png) |

  All benchmarks with exporters seem to have a throughput around ~140 workflow instance completions per second, but the benchmarks without exporters reaches ~170 workflow instance completions per second.
 When we check the metrics we can see that sometimes brokers are leader for all partition and sometimes it is good distributed, but even this makes not that huge difference as the fact to having no exporter.
 This is unexpected and we need to investigate further, created new issue for this [#5085](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/5085)
 
 The latency seems to be not affected by this.

#### General Observations

##### RocksDB

After taking a look at the metrics of the different benchmarks we can see that at one benchmark we have a higher live data size, which is unexepected.

Created an issue for it [#5081](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/5081)

##### Atomix Bootstrap

On taking a look at the logs during starting the benchmarks we can see that the logging of atomix is not really useful.

It prints several statements which seem to be just noisy.
```
I 2020-07-30T10:17:54.198527Z TCP server listening for connections on 0.0.0.0:26502

```

Created an issue for it [#5080](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/5080)

##### Merged log statement

Another issue we can see during startup is that from time the log statements are merged together in stackdriver.

Looks like this:

```

```

Created an issue for it [#5079](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/5079)

##### Wrong Exporter Configuration
When Exporter is configured falsely it breaks the start up, which means the exporter can't be loaded and we see an exception.

The Broker is shutdown afterwards.

This is works without problems. I think this is good to know.


### Code

To deploy a benchmark without exporters we had to do a `helm template` and remove all exporter related env variables.
